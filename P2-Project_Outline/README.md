### Overview
The goal of our program is to provide fleet managers with easy access to information needed to keep the vehicles in their fleet up to date and running. Managers will be able to view the current status of all of the vehicles in their fleet and receive alerts from drivers about vehicle issues. Using our program will make the management of small to medium size fleets a breeze without the need to solely rely on memory and cumbersome paper files around the office.
